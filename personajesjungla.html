  <p>
A prodigy from the rough streets of Zaun, Ekko is able to manipulate time to twist any situation to his advantage. He uses his own invention, the Z-Drive, to explore the branching possibilities of reality, crafting the perfect moment to seemingly achieve the impossible the first time, every time. Though Ekko revels in this freedom, when there's a threat to those he cares about, he and the Firelights will do anything to defend them.

  <h2> <li>Elise</li>  </h2>

  <p>
Elise is a deadly predator who dwells in a sealed, lightless palace in the heart of Noxus's oldest city. Once a mortal woman, the lady of a powerful house, the bite of an evil demigod transformed her into a beautiful, immortal, and utterly inhuman creature: a spider-like creature that lures unsuspecting prey into its web. Preying on innocents to maintain her eternal youth, Elise now prefers to feed on the naive and the faithless. Few can resist her charms.

  <p>
Within the dark seams of Runeterra, the demon Evelynn stalks her next victim. She seduces her prey with the voluptuous appearance of a human woman, but once someone succumbs to her charms, Evelynn reveals her true form. At that point, she subjects her victim to unimaginable torment and revels in their pain. To the demon, these encounters are innocent love affairs. To the rest of Runeterra, they are macabre tales of lust gone wrong and gruesome reminders of the cost of wanton desire.

  <p>
Equal parts cheerful and imposing, Gragas is a towering, provocative brewer who lives to find new ways to cheer up everyone around him. Hailing from an unknown place, he searches the Freljord wastelands for rare ingredients to create the perfect brew. Impulsive and stubborn, he became known for the brawls he starts, which often result in endless parties and extensive property damage. When Gragas appears, he brings joy and destruction, in that order.
