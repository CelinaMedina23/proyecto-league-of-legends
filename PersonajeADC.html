Sarah Fortune is undoubtedly one of Bilgewater's most notorious captains, as renowned for her looks as she is feared for her ferocity. That's why she stands out among the port city's most dangerous criminals. As a child, she witnessed her family murdered by Gangplank, the pirate king, a situation she savagely avenged years later by blowing up his flagship with him on board. Anyone who underestimates her will face a seductive and unpredictable opponentâ€”and will likely get a few bullet holes in the bargain.

She wields an arsenal of homemade weapons, unleashing massive explosions and colorful projectiles. The chaos she wreaks in her wake inspires the underdog to revolt.

Shauna Vayne is a deadly and ruthless Demacian monster hunter who has dedicated her life to seeking out and destroying the demon that murdered her family. Armed with a wrist-mounted crossbow and a heart thirsty for vengeance, Vayne is truly happy only when slaying practitioners of the dark arts or their creations, striking from the shadows with a flurry of silver bolts.

Recognized as its best agent, Caitlyn Kiramman is also Piltover's best weapon for ridding the city of its elusive criminals. She often works with Vi, serving as the logical counterpoint to her partner's more impetuous nature. Her hextech rifle isn't Caitlyn's most powerful weapon; it's a superior intellect that allows her to set traps for any lawbreaker foolish enough to operate in the City of Progress.
